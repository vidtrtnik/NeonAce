# NeonAce
A browser game, created using Wineyard3d game engine.

NeonAce is an arcade game which can be played in your favourite web browser. I developed it using my [Wineyard3d game engine](https://github.com/vidtrtnik/Wineyard3d). It is written in Javascript.

This game was created to represent and introduce the Wineyard3d engine in the first place. I plan to port it to other platforms or game engines in the future. 

The game is still in development, some features are missing. Currently it can be played on PC in web browsers only.
