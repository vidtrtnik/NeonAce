# Neon Ace
A browser game, created using Wineyard3d game engine.

Neon Ace is a free and open-source arcade game which can be played in a web browser. I developed it using my [Wineyard3d game engine](https://github.com/vidtrtnik/Wineyard3d). It is written in Javascript and WebGL.

This game was created to represent and introduce the Wineyard3d engine in the first place. It is still in development. Maybe I will port it to other platforms or game engines in the future.

## Description
The main goal of the game is to dodge the enemies and bullets and stay in the air as long as possible. You can shoot down enemy planes using a primary or a secondary weapon. All weapons have a cooldown period (primary: 1s, secondary: 5s). If you get hit or you collide with an enemy plane, your score is lost and the map restarts. Map layout is generated randomly each time you start the game.
